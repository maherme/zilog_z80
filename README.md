# zilog_z80

This is a repository where you can find some pieces of code and examples coded for the Zilog Z80 processor. The code is done based in the architecture of the Amstrad computer.

For information about the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) you can refer to this link: [Zilog Z80 ISA](https://clrhome.org/table/)

If you want to test the code in this repository you can find an Amstrad emulator here: [WinAPE](http://winape.net/)
